# hello-world
Let me introduce myself!
My name is Kelly Williams. I have a PhD in biological engineering background, but I am currently learning all I can about data science with the intention of moving into this field ASAP. I have previous experience in R and statistics that I am building on to deepen my understanding of data analysis. Look for projects demonstrating all my new skills in the near future!
